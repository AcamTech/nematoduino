Nematoduino attempts to emulate the C. Elegans nervous system
on an Arduino Uno (AtMega328). It is based heavily upon the file
'connectome.py' from this repository:

This software is a work in progress. Currently all it does is dump
the weights on the left and right muscles over the serial port.

Nematoduino is covered on the GNU Public License v2.
